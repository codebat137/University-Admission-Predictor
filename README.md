Building a Machine Learning Model to predict Graduate University Admission

Admission_predict.csv - The Data pertaining to the Project. It has 500 rows and 8 columns 
featuring  different details regarding the applicant.

The Columns are as follows:-

1. GRE Score            500 non-null int64
2. TOEFL Score          500 non-null int64
3. University Rating    500 non-null int64
4. SOP                  500 non-null float64
5. LOR                  500 non-null float64
6. CGPA                 500 non-null float64
7. Research             500 non-null int64
8. Chance of Admit      500 non-null float64

I've used Linear Regression, ANN, Decision Tree Regressor as well as Random Forest Regressor to fit
a model to predict the chance of Admission.
